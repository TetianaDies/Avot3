The process of creating the letter 0
<img src="/img/Process_Tetiana_Denysova.jpg" width="1600">
The main idea was to create emotions, here it's a snail's fear, probably a snail running away from the enemy. During the process of drawing a letter, I came up with a simplified version of the letter that you can see at the end.

*The first variant of the Letter O*<br/>
Name: OMG!	<br/>
A heavy black slanted capital letter O 	shell of a wide-eyed cartoony illustrated goofy snail.

*The second variant of the Letter O*<br/>
Name: Oops!<br/>
Slanted capital letter O looks like set as the a falling snail house with a snail that is afraid of it.
