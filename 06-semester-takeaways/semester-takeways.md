## Five Things I Learned This Semester

1. I am getting better at coding. Git hub was something new for me, I had the opportunity to repeat Html.
2. Write. Writing content taught me to be concise, use subtitles and write with humor.
3. Public Speaking Skills. Speaking English is my biggest fear. The more I spoke English, the more it helped me.
4. Present yourself. When I was preparing presentations about myself, I reconsidered my life. I understood how important to be yourself. 
5. Present my art work. The task I liked the most was to create a letter. I understood that the hardest part was describing what I had created.

Thank you for the opportunity to learn something new)
