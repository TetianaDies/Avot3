Loves creative challenges, learning new thing, and helping others to shape their vision.

## Hello! :smiley:
My name is Tetiana, 
a graphic designer and illustrator based in Prague. 
Recently Iâ€™ve been working with different clients and brands: designing books,
web site and apps, branding, promotional materials and merchandise. 
In my free time I enjoy reading books, drawing, and watching the stars.
