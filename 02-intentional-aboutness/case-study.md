 # Vital project
 
In 2015, I had the opportunity to work as a designer, illustrator, and photographer to bring a charity project to life 
that was simple and true, a basic but essential guiding design principle. The focus of the charity project The World 
of Childrenâ€™s Hopes for the Cherkasy Regional Art Museum in Ukraine was to promote the positive emotions in children 
who were being treated at the Regional Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology of the Cherkasy Regional Oncology Center.
A positive-minded child can more easily endure the hardships of having a disease than a child who doesn't believe in 
the possibilities of healing. The main goal of the project was to create a positive experience for the children by giving
them a colorful new world of hope through the use of art and design.

## Not just coloring book

Beyond creating visual content, I was working on creating a coloring book for children.

This coloring was made on the basis of drawings of sick children, who drew fantastic animals.The coloring 
book was printed like a limited edition and was given to children for free. The best drawings of *fantastic 
animals were exhibited at the Cherkasy regional art museum (Ukraine).*
The best children's drawings received a reward. It was a lot of fun to watch them try to explain what they drew.

## Design that makes sense

It's impossible to discuss the success of the project, because all children who took part in the project 
had little chance of recovery, but even such a small thing as a coloring book with unreal animals brought
them a lot of joy. Also as part of the project I had the opportunity to express themselves and 
as a photographer. All the photos that I took, were printed in many magazines.
My motivation when I working on the project was huge, because at that moment for me the design wasn't 
just making a new logo, poster and illustration, it was a real, true story behind these children
a story of pain and hope. I try to make designs that really benefit people and I love my job.
