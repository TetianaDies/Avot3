My presentation will be about my experience in graphic design. I also remember my mistakes and problems that I had when I working with clients. 
As you can see from one of my most common mistakes, I didn't save my work many times. Well let's drop it now...

I have a big family, and my nephew didn't want to do homework, that's why it started with one drawing, and it didn't end.
His teacher start to believe that my nephew really drew well. It was a lie, I wanted to stop helping them, but my mom pushed on me, that I must to help them, again and again. 
Also I had to draw like a child, that's why this paintings are so imperfect.

I selected only the pictures that I found on my laptop. But I don't have here one an important picture, it was also his homework. That picture was sent to the competition and like not me, but my nephew won the second place in this competition. I was glad, that my drawing wasn't so bad.

I don't even remember how the neighbors found out, that I could draw. They also have a boy who didn't want to draw homework for school. They came for me and I drew a New Year forest. At that moment I understood, that I couldnÂ´t say NO to anyone, and that drawing for children was so easy. I started to like it. I was like a Yes man.

Then came real work and experience.

I decided if I would draw small paintings, I would be rich. But it was a mistake, no one wanted to sell it for more than 100 CZK. At that moment, there was no e-shop and people didn't buy much over the internet. And I stopped painted it.

Than i decide, that I will be a designer and will draw on a computer. My first client was a girl who wanted to do a massage and they needed a business card. I created a lot of creative idea of what it might look like. Well, she chose a simple design without creativity. When I looking at it now, and I don't like what I did.

More and more people knew that I could do design. A lady from a non-profit organization found me. She wanted to create a new visual style. It was my first big job. She liked my design, she uses this logo until now. But I don't know why, she doesn't follow corporate colors. When I tried to explain it to her, she told me, that she want to use green color, because they like it. You can see it on web site.

I also made a handout for the one company and I work on that for one year!!!!, because the management didn't know what they wanted and what it should look like. They made me angry that they used my pictograms from the this brochure on the web site and didn't tell me anything about it.

My one of the last great works for a friend, it was for free. It is a theater, with short name a wasp. They had a terrible website. I deside to help them to created a better website and visual style. They told me that they liked it. But they haven't changed that web site until today!!! I think i have bad luck.
